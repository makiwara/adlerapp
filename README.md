Attunement: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book

## The Premise
Mortimer Adler wrote a great book which inspires every reader to read books in a proper, mindful way. But it is very hard to read books in such manner. We, thoughtful readers, need assistance on our path.

The premise of this venture is to found a brobdingnagian Book Reader Club named after Mortimer Adler. The purpose of the club is to gather people who is capable of ‘reading’ books, and to help them with their work of mind.

Such clubs are usually found around apps and websites these days. Let our venture not to be an exclusion.


## The Promise
The very first product to help with our foundation would be a compact one, MVP, that will help users to read certain books in a correct way, the Adler way mostly. 

* to jot out and store quotations,
* to compose key theses,
* to build up argumentation structure linking quotations to theses,
* to create a vocabulary of ideas,
* and, finally, to come out with critique.

Basic idea behind the product is to create a room to talk about books: to make contentful statements and to discuss them.
